# llm-wiki

A headless wiki engine for agents. 23 MCP tools. One Rust binary. No LLM inside.

**Build knowledge that compounds — not answers that evaporate.**

A git-backed Markdown wiki — searchable, typed, graph-linked. Accessible from
the command line, from any MCP-compatible agent, or from any IDE via ACP.

---

## The problem with RAG

Most AI knowledge tools retrieve and generate on every query. Each answer is
disposable — nothing is learned, nothing is kept. Ask the same question twice
and the LLM reasons from scratch.

llm-wiki implements a different pattern — the **Dynamic Knowledge Repository**
(DKR), introduced by Andrej Karpathy:

> Process sources at ingest time, not query time. The LLM integrates each
> source into the wiki — updating concept pages, creating source summaries,
> flagging contradictions — and commits the result. Knowledge compounds with
> every addition.

|                         | Traditional RAG       | llm-wiki (DKR)              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| When knowledge is built | At query time         | At ingest time              |
| Cross-references        | Ad hoc or missed      | Pre-built, typed graph      |
| Knowledge accumulation  | Resets each query     | Compounds over time         |
| Audit trail             | None                  | Git history per page        |
| Data ownership          | Provider systems      | Your files, your git repo   |

## How it works

The engine is pure infrastructure. It manages files, git, full-text search,
and graph structure. The LLM is always external — it calls the engine's tools
via MCP, reads pages, writes pages, and commits knowledge. Intelligence flows
through skills, not the binary.

```
LLM agent
  │
  ├── wiki_list(format: "llms")             → all pages grouped by type
  ├── wiki_search("mixture of experts")     → ranked results + facets
  ├── wiki_content_read("concepts/moe")     → full page + backlinks
  ├── wiki_graph(root: "concepts/moe")      → typed graph in Mermaid/DOT
  ├── wiki_suggest("concepts/moe")          → pages worth linking
  ├── wiki_content_new("concepts/new-page") → scaffold + returns local path
  ├── [write directly to path]              → no MCP round-trip
  └── wiki_ingest(path: "concepts/")        → validate, index, commit
```

A wiki page is a plain Markdown file with typed frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: concept
title: Mixture of Experts
status: active
confidence: 0.9
tags: [routing, scaling, efficiency]
sources:
  - sources/switch-transformer-2021
  - sources/mixtral-2024
concepts:
  - concepts/sparse-routing
  - concepts/scaling-laws
---

Sparse routing of tokens to expert subnetworks...
```

The engine validates frontmatter against a JSON Schema, extracts typed graph
edges from `sources` and `concepts`, and indexes everything in tantivy. The
graph is live the moment a page is committed.

## IDE integration via ACP

In addition to MCP, llm-wiki speaks **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol) — a
session-oriented streaming protocol over stdio. Connect from Zed or any
ACP-compatible editor and trigger built-in workflows directly from the IDE
panel:

| Prompt | What runs |
| ------ | --------- |
| `llm-wiki:research <query>` | Search + read top results, stream summaries |
| `llm-wiki:lint [rules]` | Run structural lint rules, stream findings |
| `llm-wiki:graph [root]` | Build and stream the concept graph |
| `llm-wiki:ingest [path]` | Ingest a path, stream the report |
| `llm-wiki:use <slug>` | Stream a page body directly into the IDE |
| `llm-wiki:help` | List all available workflows |

Start with `--acp` alongside `--http` to give ACP exclusive stdio:

```bash
llm-wiki serve --acp --http :18765
```

## What agents can do

| Tool | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `wiki_search` | BM25 full-text search across one or all wikis, with type/status/tag facets |
| `wiki_list` | Paginated page listing with filters; `format: "llms"` for LLM-readable output |
| `wiki_content_read` | Read a page with optional backlinks |
| `wiki_content_write` | Write a page (validates frontmatter against type schema) |
| `wiki_content_new` | Scaffold a new page; returns local `path` for direct writes |
| `wiki_resolve` | Resolve a slug or `wiki://` URI to its local filesystem path |
| `wiki_ingest` | Validate a path, update the index, commit to git |
| `wiki_graph` | Typed concept graph — Mermaid, DOT, or natural-language `llms` format |
| `wiki_suggest` | Find pages worth linking by tag overlap, graph distance, BM25 similarity |
| `wiki_stats` | Wiki health: page counts, type distribution, staleness, graph density |
| `wiki_lint` | Deterministic quality rules: orphans, broken links, missing fields, stale pages |
| `wiki_export` | Write full wiki to `llms.txt` at wiki root — for ecosystem publishing or audit |
| `wiki_history` | Git commit history for a page, with rename following |
| `wiki_schema` | Show, validate, or template a type schema |
| `wiki_spaces_*` | Create, register, list, remove wiki spaces; supports custom `wiki_root` |

## Skills

The engine exposes tools. Skills tell agents how to use them.

[llm-wiki-skills](https://github.com/geronimo-iia/llm-wiki-skills) is a
Claude Code plugin that ships ready-to-use workflows:

| Skill | What it does |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `crystallize` | Distil a session into durable wiki pages — decisions, findings, open questions |
| `ingest` | Process source files from `inbox/` into synthesized, cross-referenced pages |
| `research` | Search the wiki and synthesize an answer from existing knowledge |
| `lint` | Structural audit — orphans, broken links, schema issues, under-linked pages |
| `graph` | Explore and interpret the concept graph |

Skills are plain Markdown files — readable by the LLM, replaceable, forkable.
Write your own for your own workflows.

---

## Architecture

```
llm-wiki-engine          pure Rust binary — tools, git, index, graph
llm-wiki-skills          Claude Code plugin — workflow skills (Markdown)
llm-wiki-hugo-cms        Hugo scaffold — render the wiki as a website
```

The engine has no opinions about workflows, LLM providers, or interfaces.
Every LLM call happens outside the binary. Every workflow lives in a skill.
The separation means skills ship independently, the engine stays stable, and
nothing is coupled to a specific AI provider.

---

## Technology

The file format is Markdown. The history store is git. Both predate llm-wiki
and will outlive it — your wiki is readable, diffable, and portable with zero
dependency on this tool. The engine itself is a single Rust binary with no
runtime, no database, and nothing to keep running between sessions.

Single Rust binary. No runtime, no database, no Docker.

| Component | Technology |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Search | [tantivy](https://crates.io/crates/tantivy) — BM25, Lucene-class performance |
| Git | [git2](https://crates.io/crates/git2) — libgit2 bindings |
| Graph | [petgraph](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph) — typed DiGraph |
| MCP | [rmcp](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp) — stdio + Streamable HTTP |
| ACP | [agent-client-protocol](https://crates.io/crates/agent-client-protocol) |

## Why I built this

Like many of you, I've been exploring agents, LLMs, and all that comes with it.
This project started after Andrej Karpathy's post — he put into words something
I was already practicing: plain Markdown files with structured frontmatter as a
practical knowledge base, for work and for the messier explorations.

The technical direction reflects years of SRE-minded practice: minimize
dependencies, use proven tools, keep the binary dumb. Written in Rust with
Claude as a pair programmer — a language I enjoy exploring more and more.

I have "a few" years of experience, but if you spot bad practices, call them
out — I'm doing this to learn together too. And if you're using it, personally
or at work, I'd love to hear about it :)
