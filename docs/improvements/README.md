# Improvements

Proposed improvements derived from the comparative analysis in `docs/analysys/`.
Ordered by implementation priority — each item either stands alone or unblocks the
items that follow it.

| # | File | Summary | Depends on |
|---|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | [confidence.md](confidence.md) | Add `confidence: 0.0–1.0` to base schema; numeric tantivy field; search ranking multiplier | — |
| 2 | [search-ranking.md](search-ranking.md) | `tweak_score` inside collector: status × confidence multipliers, true top-k ranking | #1 |
| 3 | [backlinks.md](backlinks.md) | `backlinks: bool` on `wiki_content_read`; tantivy term query on `body_links` | — |
| 4 | [lint.md](lint.md) | `wiki_lint` engine tool (5 deterministic rules) + skill update to call it | #1 |
| 5 | [incremental-validation.md](incremental-validation.md) | Restrict `wiki_ingest` validation to git-changed files via `collect_changed_files` | — |
| 6 | [redaction.md](redaction.md) | Opt-in `redact: true` on `wiki_ingest`; built-in patterns + per-wiki `wiki.toml` config | — |
| 7 | [crystallize.md](crystallize.md) | Two-step extraction pass, confidence calibration table, post-ingest lint step in `crystallize` skill | #1, #4 |

Items 1–2 are coupled: implement confidence first, then wire it into search ranking
in the same pass. Items 3, 5, 6 are fully independent. Item 4 (lint) can start
without confidence but the `stale` rule becomes richer once #1 is in place.
Item 7 is skill-only: no engine work required, but benefits from confidence (#1)
being in the index and lint (#4) being available as an engine tool.

| 8 | [community-detection.md](community-detection.md) | Louvain clustering on `petgraph::DiGraph`; `communities` in `wiki_stats`; strategy 4 in `wiki_suggest` | — |
| 9  | [export.md](export.md) | `format: "llms"` on `wiki_list`/`wiki_search`/`wiki_graph`; `wiki_export(path:)` writes full wiki to file | #1 |
| 10 | [cross-wiki-links.md](cross-wiki-links.md) | `wiki://` URIs as link targets; cross-wiki edges resolved at graph build time; `wiki_graph(cross_wiki: true)` | — |
| 11 | [ingest-two-step.md](ingest-two-step.md) | Explicit analysis pass in `ingest` skill before writes: enumerate entities, detect contradictions, produce ingest plan | — |
| 12 | [review-skill.md](review-skill.md) | New `review` skill: prioritized queue from `wiki_lint` + draft/low-confidence pages; guided review loop per page | #1, #4 |
