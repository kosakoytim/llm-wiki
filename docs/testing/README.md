# Testing

End-to-end validation for the llm-wiki CLI and Claude plugin.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/setup-test-env.sh` | Create the persistent test environment and export env vars |
| `scripts/clean-test-env.sh` | Remove the test environment and unset env vars |
| `scripts/validate-engine.sh` | Orchestrate all validation sections |
| `scripts/sections/NN-*.sh` | One validation section per file (sourced by the orchestrator) |
| `scripts/lib/helpers.sh` | Shared `pass`/`fail`/`run`/`run_json` helpers |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the binary
cargo build --release

# 2. Create the test environment and export env vars
source ./docs/testing/scripts/setup-test-env.sh

# 3. Run all validations
LLM_WIKI_BIN=./target/release/llm-wiki \
./docs/testing/scripts/validate-engine.sh

# 4. Inspect results in ~/llm-wiki-testing/ (see layout below)

# 5. Run a single section (e.g. ingest only)
LLM_WIKI_BIN=./target/release/llm-wiki \
./docs/testing/scripts/validate-engine.sh --section 05

# 6. Clean up when done
source ./docs/testing/scripts/clean-test-env.sh
```

`source` is required for `setup-test-env.sh` and `clean-test-env.sh` so
that `LLM_WIKI_TEST_DIR` and `LLM_WIKI_CONFIG` are exported/unset in
your current shell. Running them directly also works but won't affect the
parent shell's environment.

## Ephemeral mode

Omit `source ./setup-test-env.sh` and don't set `LLM_WIKI_TEST_DIR` — the
script creates a tmpdir automatically and cleans it up on exit:

```bash
LLM_WIKI_BIN=./target/release/llm-wiki ./docs/testing/scripts/validate-engine.sh
```

Useful for CI where you don't need to inspect results.

## Skills validation

Open `docs/testing/validate-skills.md` and run each scenario in Claude
with the plugin active. Both wikis must be registered before starting
(run `setup-test-env.sh` first or register them manually).

## Deliberate fixtures for lint rules

| Page | Rule triggered | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `concepts/orphan-concept.md` | `orphan` | No inbound or outbound links |
| `concepts/broken-link-concept.md` | `broken-link` | `concepts` field references `concepts/does-not-exist` |
| `concepts/compute-efficiency.md` | `stale` (over time) | Low confidence draft |

## Deliberate contradictions

- `concepts/sparse-routing` claims compute cost is O(k/n)
- `concepts/compute-efficiency` draft claims compute cost is O(n)
- `02-article-moe-efficiency.md` also argues the O(k/n) claim is misleading

These are intentional for testing the ingest analysis step (imp-11) and
the review skill (imp-12).

## Source layout

Static test data committed to the repo:

```
tests/fixtures/
  wikis/
    research/                ← primary test wiki (MoE / transformer domain)
      wiki.toml              ← sets min_nodes_for_communities=5 for community tests
      wiki/
        concepts/            ← 6 concept pages (includes orphan + broken-link fixtures)
        sources/             ← 1 source page
        inbox/               ← empty placeholder; setup copies inbox/ files here
    notes/                   ← second wiki for cross-wiki tests
      wiki.toml
      wiki/
        concepts/            ← 1 concept page (attention-mechanism, cross-wiki target)
  inbox/
    01-paper-switch-transformer.md  ← rich paper; tests ingest + contradiction detection
    02-article-moe-efficiency.md    ← article; tests claim contradiction with sparse-routing
    03-note-with-secrets.md         ← contains fake API keys; tests redaction
    04-note-cross-wiki.md           ← contains wiki:// links; tests cross-wiki
    05-data-benchmark-scores.csv    ← CSV; tests data source type classification
```

## Testing layout

What `setup-test-env.sh` creates at `~/llm-wiki-testing/` (or `--dir` path):

```
~/llm-wiki-testing/          ← LLM_WIKI_TEST_DIR
  config.toml                ← LLM_WIKI_CONFIG — isolated engine config (space registry)
  indexes/
    research/                ← tantivy index for research wiki
    notes/                   ← tantivy index for notes wiki
  wikis/
    research/                ← copy of tests/fixtures/wikis/research
      wiki.toml
      wiki/
        concepts/
        sources/
        inbox/               ← inbox fixtures copied here before each validation run
    notes/                   ← copy of tests/fixtures/wikis/notes
      wiki.toml
      wiki/
        concepts/
```

Export files (`wiki_export`) and other validation artefacts are written
directly to `~/llm-wiki-testing/` so you can inspect them after a run.
