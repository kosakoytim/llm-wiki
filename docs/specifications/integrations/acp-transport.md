# ACP Transport

ACP (Agent Client Protocol) is a session-oriented, streaming protocol
over stdio/NDJSON. `llm-wiki serve --acp` makes llm-wiki a first-class
IDE agent with zero MCP configuration required.


## Why ACP

MCP is request/response — the IDE calls a tool, gets a result, no
streaming. ACP is session-oriented and streaming — every step of a
multi-step workflow streams back as events visible to the user.

| Concern                  | MCP stdio           | ACP stdio            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Zed agent panel          | requires MCP config | native — zero config |
| Streaming workflow steps | not visible         | streams as events    |
| Session continuity       | stateless           | named sessions       |
| Cancel mid-workflow      | not supported       | `cancel` message     |

**Important:** ACP `tool_call` events are IDE notifications — they show
the user what the server is doing. They are not LLM-invoked tool calls.
The LLM sends one prompt; the server runs a fixed Rust workflow and streams
progress back. The LLM has no agency mid-workflow.

Multi-step agentic work (deciding which tools to call based on results)
requires MCP. ACP and MCP are complementary, not exclusive.


## Protocol

ACP is NDJSON over stdio. Key messages:

| Message      | Direction     | Purpose                                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `initialize` | client → wiki | Start session, wiki sends capabilities     |
| `newSession` | client → wiki | Create named session                       |
| `prompt`     | client → wiki | Submit user message                        |
| `cancel`     | client → wiki | Cancel active run                          |
| `message`    | wiki → client | Streaming assistant text                   |
| `tool_call`  | wiki → client | Streaming tool invocation (visible in IDE) |
| `done`       | wiki → client | Run complete                               |


## Session Model

Sessions are transient conversation threads stored in memory for the
process lifetime. A session targets a specific wiki from the spaces
config (default wiki if not specified).

### Session fields

| Field        | Type               | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`         | `String`           | Unique ID assigned at `NewSession` (millisecond timestamp)   |
| `label`      | `Option<String>`   | Human-readable name; shown in IDE session list               |
| `wiki`       | `Option<String>`   | Wiki name from `NewSession` metadata; falls back to default  |
| `created_at` | `u64`              | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the session was created        |
| `active_run` | `Option<String>`   | ID of the currently executing tool run, or `None`            |
| `cancelled`  | `Arc<AtomicBool>`  | Cooperative cancellation flag (see below)                    |

### Cancel semantics

When a client sends a `cancel` notification, the server sets
`cancelled = true` (atomic, Relaxed ordering). Each workflow polls this
flag at safe points between steps:

- `research` — after search, before read
- `lint` — between each finding streamed
- `graph` — before dispatch
- `ingest` — before dispatch

On cancellation, the workflow sends `"Cancelled."` to the session and
exits cleanly. The flag is reset to `false` at the start of each new
`Prompt`.

### Session cap

`serve.acp_max_sessions` (default: 20) limits concurrent sessions.
`NewSession` returns an `InvalidParams` error when the cap is reached.

### Watcher push

When `llm-wiki serve --acp --watch` is running, the filesystem watcher
pushes a notification to all idle sessions (no active run) targeting the
changed wiki:

```
Wiki "<name>" updated: <N> page(s) changed.
```

The watcher sends `(wiki_name, message)` tuples via a `tokio::sync::mpsc`
channel. The ACP server's push task blocks on a `tokio::sync::watch` channel
until the first `Prompt` arrives and establishes the connection handle —
watcher events that arrive before the first prompt are buffered in the mpsc
channel and delivered once the connection is ready. Sessions with an active
run are skipped to avoid interleaving messages.


## Zed Configuration

Zed needs **both** ACP and MCP configured to use the full workflow:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "llm-wiki": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "llm-wiki",
      "args": ["serve", "--acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  },
  "context_servers": {
    "llm-wiki-mcp": {
      "command": "llm-wiki",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **ACP** (`agent_servers`) — streaming panel, workflow triggers, skill loading
- **MCP** (`context_servers`) — LLM tool calls for agentic work (write pages,
  search, resolve slugs, etc.)

With ACP only, the LLM is limited to triggering fixed server-side workflows.
With both, the LLM can follow skills (loaded via `llm-wiki:use`) and call
any of the 22 MCP tools directly.


## Workflows

Prompts are dispatched by prefix. Bare prompts (no `llm-wiki:` prefix) default
to the `research` workflow.

```
llm-wiki:<workflow> <args>
```

### Dispatch rules

| Prefix | Workflow | Args |
|--------|----------|------|
| `llm-wiki:research <query>` | research | search query |
| `llm-wiki:lint [rules]` | lint | comma-separated rule names, or empty for all |
| `llm-wiki:graph [slug]` | graph | optional root slug for subgraph |
| `llm-wiki:ingest [path]` | ingest | path to file or directory; defaults to wiki root |
| `llm-wiki:use <slug>` | use | slug of page to read in full |
| `llm-wiki:help` | help | — |
| `<bare prompt>` | research | full prompt text as query |
| `llm-wiki:<unknown>` | — | error → help hint |

### `research`

Searches the wiki and reads the top result.

```
→ tool_call: wiki_search("<query>")
→ tool_result: top matches
→ tool_call: wiki_content_read("<top-slug>")
→ message: slug list
→ done
```

Streams a gap note when no results found. Multi-step synthesis with
decisions belongs in the `research` skill (MCP + skills), not here.

### `lint`

Runs lint rules and streams each finding.

```
→ tool_call: wiki_lint [rules=<rules>]
→ tool_result: "<N> findings (<E> errors, <W> warnings)"
→ message: "[<severity>] <slug>: <message>"  (one per finding)
→ done
```

`rules` is a comma-separated subset of: `orphan`, `broken-link`,
`missing-fields`, `stale`, `unknown-type`, `broken-cross-wiki-link`.
Empty or absent means all rules.

### `graph`

Renders the concept graph in `llms` format.

```
→ tool_call: wiki_graph [root=<slug>]
→ tool_result: "Graph: <N> nodes, <E> edges"
→ message: <llms-format graph description>
→ done
```

If `slug` is provided, renders a subgraph rooted at that slug (default depth
from config). Empty prompt renders the full wiki graph.

### `ingest`

Validates and indexes pages, then reports the result.

```
→ tool_call: wiki_ingest: <path>
→ tool_result: "Ingested: <N> pages validated, <W> warnings, commit=<sha|none>"
→ done
```

Path defaults to the wiki root when omitted. Warnings are counted but not
individually streamed (use `lint` to inspect individual findings).

### `use`

Reads a single page and streams its full body to the IDE. Primary use:
loading a skill from the wiki into the agent context so the LLM can follow
its instructions using MCP tools.

```
→ tool_call: wiki_content_read("<slug>")
→ tool_result: <page body>
→ done
```

Requires a slug argument. Responds with a usage hint if omitted.

Example:
```
llm-wiki:use skills/research   → loads research skill
llm-wiki:use skills/ingest     → loads ingest skill
llm-wiki:use skills/crystallize → loads crystallize skill
```

After loading a skill, the LLM follows its instructions using MCP tool calls.

### `help`

Returns a plain-text listing of all available workflows with one-line
descriptions. Also returned (with an "unknown workflow" prefix) for any
unrecognised `llm-wiki:<x>` prefix.

### Error contract

All workflows follow the same error contract: on `ops` failure, the tool call
status is set to `Failed` with the error message in the result body, and the
workflow exits cleanly (no panic, no `done` suppressed). The IDE always
receives a `done` event.


## ACP + MCP + Skills: combined workflow

The three layers are designed to work together:

```
llm-wiki:use skills/crystallize     ← ACP: load skill body into LLM context
                ↓
LLM reads skill, follows instructions using MCP:
  wiki_content_new("concept/moe-scaling")   ← MCP tool call
  wiki_content_write(slug, body)            ← MCP tool call
                ↓
llm-wiki:ingest                     ← ACP: trigger ingest, stream progress
```

ACP handles streaming and IDE visibility. MCP gives the LLM tool access.
Skills tell the LLM what to do.


## What ACP Does Not Replace

- **MCP stdio** — agentic tool use, Claude Code, batch ingest
- **MCP SSE** — remote multi-client access (ACP is stdio-only)

See [server.md](../engine/server.md) for transport configuration and
[mcp-clients.md](mcp-clients.md) for MCP client setup.
