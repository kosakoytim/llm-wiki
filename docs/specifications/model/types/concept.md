# Concept Type

Schema: `schemas/concept.json` (extends `base.json`)

Two types share this schema:

| Type           | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept`      | Synthesized knowledge — one concept per page        |
| `query-result` | Saved conclusion — crystallized session, comparison |

## Additional Fields

| Field        | Type         | Required | Default | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `read_when`  | list[string] | yes      |         | Retrieval conditions (situations, not keywords) |
| `tldr`       | string       | no       | none    | One-sentence key takeaway                       |
| `sources`    | list[string] | no       | `[]`    | Slugs of source pages that contributed claims   |
| `concepts`   | list[string] | no       | `[]`    | Slugs of concept pages this page depends on     |
| `confidence` | float 0.0–1.0 | no      | `0.5`   | Certainty of page content. See [base.md](base.md). Legacy strings `high`/`medium`/`low` are read as `0.9`/`0.5`/`0.2`. |
| `claims`     | list[claim]  | no       | `[]`    | Structured claims extracted from sources        |

## Claims

A claim is a factual statement extracted from a source, with optional
confidence and location:

| Field        | Type          | Required | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `text`       | string        | yes      | The claim as a factual statement              |
| `confidence` | float 0.0–1.0 | no       | Certainty of this claim. Same scale as page-level `confidence`. |
| `source`     | string        | no       | Slug of the source page                       |
| `section`    | string        | no       | Section in the source where the claim appears |

Conventional values: `0.9` = well-corroborated; `0.5` = single source or caveats; `0.2` = speculative.
Absence means no certainty signal was recorded (distinct from `0.5` neutral).

```yaml
claims:
  - text: "Sparse MoE reduces effective compute 8x"
    confidence: 0.9
    source: sources/switch-transformer-2021
    section: "Results"
```

## Edge Declarations

| Field           | Relation        | Target types     |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `sources`       | `fed-by`        | All source types |
| `concepts`      | `depends-on`    | `concept`        |
| `superseded_by` | `superseded-by` | Any              |
