## Notes

The `design/` folder contains historical design documents. The specifications
folder is the source of truth for current contracts and behavior.

[rust-modules.md](rust-modules.md) is the canonical reference for the `src/`
module layout — consult it when a spec's "Rust Module Changes" table is
ambiguous.
